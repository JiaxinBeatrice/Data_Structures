# Data_Structures
final project of the course

## Topic
Finish implementation of UBike renting system

## Data Structures used
* Hash Table : store pointer of bikes, chaining when collision
* Heap : always rent the bike with smallest millage
* Graph : rent rate is related to the shortest distance between the stations where you rent and return, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is used.
